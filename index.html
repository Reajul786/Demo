        This easy curry chicken dish is the standard curry chicken. No fuss, just yummy and creamy curry.
        Rich in coconut milk and spices, this dish is a must-try. As the chicken pieces are marinated in curry paste before cooking,
        the taste of the meat is enhanced.

        <p>
          Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;[2] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[3] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[4] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture
